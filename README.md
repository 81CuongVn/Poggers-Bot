# Poggers Bot Source Code
This is the source code for my discord bot [Poggers Bot](https://dsc.gg/poggers-bot). It is made using an npm package called [Aoi.JS](https://npmjs.org/package/aoi.js) meant to simplify discord bot development, and lots of other packages.

## Extra stuff
Poggers Bot is a private bot, I recently made it private because i don't want to deal with discord's message intents application and whatnot if it gets verified. Poggers Bot is hosted 24/7 on [replit](https://replit.com) using [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/).

Poggers Bot was made with <3 by Faizen (@NotFaizen#3463) and Sophie (@XxSophiexX#3026).
